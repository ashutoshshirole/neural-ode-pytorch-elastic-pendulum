# neural-ode-pytorch-elastic-pendulum
Builds a Neural ODE in PyTorch that learns elastic pendulum dynamics from SciPy (solve_ivp) simulation data. The learned continuous-time model is evaluated against ground truth using trajectory overlays, phase portraits, and RMSE-over-time to verify fidelity and generalization.
